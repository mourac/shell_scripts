The included logs.txt file includes timing information for certain phases of a test run.

Examples:

*** Finishing scenario took 8 seconds
*** Deleted test user took 0.52 seconds
*** Cleanup scenario took 2 seconds


Write a script taking the logs.txt file and calculates the average of each phase.


$ ./calculate_duration_stats.rb logs.txt

-----------------------------------------
                                  Average
Created test user                     0.8
Setting up scenario                  10.4
Finishing scenario                   22.3
Deleted test user                     0.5
Cleanup scenario                      1.4
-----------------------------------------


Extra Credit: Adapt script to accept an optional parameter for producing results in JSON

$ ./calculate_duration_stats.rb logs.txt --format=json

  "Created test user": 0.8,
  "Setting up scenario": 10.4,
  "Finishing scenario": 22.3,
